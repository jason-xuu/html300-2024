# Activity 09 - API Fetching with Axios & Nuxt

We will be using Nuxt and Axios to pull from an API and populate a page with Card components using dynamic data.

### Vue References

- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation)
- [Vue Docs](https://vuejs.org/guide)

### To get started:

- Use fetch to get data from the [restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com/#endpoints-region) endpoint
- Create a page for 'Africa' and a page for 'America'​
- For each page, use fetch() to retrieve data about countries using the REST Countries API.
- Create a Card component that includes the country's flag with alt/src, a heading with the country's name, and a p with the subregion.
- Import the Card into your pages files and create a v-for loop to print each country.
